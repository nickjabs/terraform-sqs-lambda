Terraform code creates the following infrastructure:

An SQS queue named example-queue.
An IAM role named lambda-sqs-role that allows Lambda functions to access SQS queues.
An IAM policy named sqs-access-policy that allows the lambda-sqs-role role to access the example-queue queue.
An IAM role policy attachment that attaches the sqs-access-policy to the lambda-sqs-role role.
A Lambda function named example_lambda that is triggered by messages in the example-queue queue.
An SQS queue policy that allows the example_lambda Lambda function to send messages to the example-queue queue.
This infrastructure can be used to create a variety of serverless applications. For example, you could use it to create a system that sends email notifications when new messages are added to the SQS queue. Or, you could use it to create a system that processes data from the SQS queue and stores it in a database.
